           I am in the Web Design program. Prior to enrolling in school at Fox Valley Technical College, I had never programmed a computer in my life,
           but I thought, "Why not?" I like to create things and I enjoy the programming side as well. My intent when I am finished with this program is to find work
           as a Web Designer and then complete my associate's degree in Web Development.

            I currently work as a contractor with an assignment at a Google facility close by our house. Until 2023, I had lived in Wisconsin all my life, and worked in plastics manufacturing for nearly twenty years. We relocated last year when my wife got a job in Charleston, South Carolina with a non-profit engineering organization that is working to solve the global water crisis. Her organization goes into developing countries, disaster areas, and war zones providing safe water, healthy latrines, and sanitation training.

            When I am not busy with work or school, I am a musician. I play drums and dabble with guitar. My wife and I also enjoy kayaking and hiking. There are tons of places to do these things here as we are about thiry minutes from the ocean and about an hour from the upstate mountains. We also enjoy our almost one year old deaf puppy and two grumpy cats.
